There's been a flurry of Extempore development in the last couple of
weeks, most of which has revolved around the installation and
precompilation process on Linux. This has (hopefully) culminated in
the release of Extempore 0.57 this afternoon on GitHub and homebrew.

Some highlights of Extempore 0.57 include

- [[file:2013-11-12-building-extempore-through-homebrew.org][Homebrew installation]] on Ubuntu should Just Work(TM)
- [[file:2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-osx-linux.org][Building from source]] should be pretty straightforward on all
  distros
- [[file:2013-12-16-building-the-extempore-standard-library.org][Building the standard library]] is now fixed on Linux
- a =--with-stdlib= option for =brew install= to automatically build
  the standard library

Long story short, if you've given Extempore on Linux a go in the past
and given up, then it might be a good time to have another try. I hope
it'll be a lot nicer this time around. In particular, there are some
significant bug fixes for the precomp stuff, which make hacking xtlang
on Linux much nicer (startup times of ~10sec vs several minutes).

If you're on a Linux distro that isn't covered by the installation
instructions linked above, I hope it'll still be easier than it was
before.

It's worth saying that on Ubuntu, the default audio setup (e.g.
pulseaudio) isn't great for low-latency DSP stuff, so you might have
to mess around with that a bit.

OSX users should see a few improvements as well. Basically, there's no
reason not to go and get yourself a fresh 0.57 install (or even a Git
HEAD build if you're into that sort of thing).

As usual, if you have any comments (or war stories) then let us know
on the [[mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com][mailing list]].
