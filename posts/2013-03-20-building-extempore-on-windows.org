*This documentation is now hosted at* [[http://digego.github.io/extempore/]]

**Update October 2015** building from source is now much easier
(assuming you're happy to use the GitHub master branch). Updated
instructions can now be found in the [[https://github.com/digego/extempore/blob/master/INSTALL.md][INSTALL.md]] file in the Extempore
source distribution.
