/Note: if you're unfamiliar with some of the concepts presented here,
you might find the [[file:../extempore-docs/index.org][docs index]] helpful./

The best way to think about programming and evaluating code in
Extempore is to think of it as a /compiler-as-a-service/ (CaaS). The
compiler (provided by the =extempore= executable) runs in a shell
console, and you connect to it via a TCP socket connection. When the
compiler receives any code over this connection it compiles and
executes it. The general term for this is 'evaluating' the code. There
are some nuances to this process, but in general the programmer
interacts with a running Extempore process over a TCP connection.

The 'chunks' of code (serialised as strings) which are sent to the
xtlang compiler may be anything from small one-liners to whole source
files (via the =load= function). The functions and data (often
referred to collectively as the /environment/) persist for as long as
the =extempore= process is running. As discussed in [[file:2012-08-07-extempore-philosophy.org][this post]], the
Extempore compiler actually compiles /two/ languages: Scheme and
xtlang (Extempore's own programming language).[fn:scm-vs-xtlang] But
the process of evaluating them is the same---just sending strings to
the compiler over the TCP port.

So, to do anything in Extempore you need a text editor which can
1. open up a TCP connection to the compiler
2. create a string which represents a valid chunk of Scheme or xtlang
   code
3. send that string over the TCP connection[fn:security]

There are lots of text editors which can perform these functions, so
you basically have two options:

- *If you already have a favourite text editor*, then you'll probably
  want to write and evaluate your code using that editor. There are
  already Extempore modes/plugins for [[https://github.com/digego/extempore/blob/master/extras/extempore.el][Emacs]], [[https://github.com/digego/extempore/blob/master/extras/extempore.vim][vim]] and [[https://github.com/benswift/extempore-sublime][Sublime Text 2]]
  (see the =extras= subdirectory).
  If your favourite editor isn't one of those three, then you might
  even have the chops to hack together a plugin yourself---at its most
  basic all it has to do is perform those three functions listed above
  (you can even use =telnet= or =netcat=).

- *If you don't have a favourite text editor* then pick one of the
  ones listed above ([[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], [[http://www.vim.org][vim]] or [[http://www.sublimetext.com][Sublime Text 2]]). The Emacs
  Extempore mode is the most mature and featureful. However, if you
  don't want to deal with the (admittedly daunting) task of learning
  Emacs /as well as/ Extempore, then the ST2 plugin is pretty good as
  well (although ST2 does cost money).

There are some "cheat sheets" for using Extempore in [[file:2012-10-10-extempore-emacs-cheat-sheet.org][Emacs]], [[file:2014-11-07-hacking-extempore-in-vim.org][vim]] and
[[file:2012-10-23-extempore-st2-cheat-sheet.org][ST2]]. In the end it doesn't matter too much which editor you use, so
pick the one that makes you happiest :)

* Running Extempore

I'm assuming that you've already downloaded and built the Extempore
binary executable. It will be called =extempore= on OSX or Linux
([[file:2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-osx-linux.org][installation instructions]]) and =extempore.exe= on Windows
([[file:2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-windows.org][installation instructions]]). 

When you start Extempore, you need to specify an audio device. This is
necessary even if you're not planning to do any audio processing or
output, because Extempore's internal clock is driven by the audio
device's clock.[fn:clock]

But how do we know what audio device to select? Well, the =extempore=
executable provides a handy command-line argument called
=--print-devices=. At a shell prompt, =cd= into the extempore source
directory (where the executable will be) and run

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/extempore-print-devices.png"
         alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

As you can see, running =extempore= with the =--print-devices=
argument prints a list of all the audio devices (input, output and
duplex) that PortAudio can find on the system. On my laptop (as you
can see above) there are five devices. Three devices (device index =0=
to =2=) are for the built-in soundcard, and two more (device index =3=
and =4=) are for [[http://code.google.com/p/soundflower/][Soundflower]], which is a utility for routing audio
between different applications. Your computer will probably print
different devices---that's ok.

For now, I want to use the default laptop output, which is =audio
device[2]=. When I run =extempore=, then, I want to pass this device
index with the =--device= argument. The =--device= argument is
optional, if it's not supplied then Extempore will default to using
whatever device is found at index =0=. But it's probably a good idea
to specify it explicitly, just to avoid any surprises.

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/extempore-start.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

After running =extempore= with =--device 2=, it
prints some information to =stdout= (which I'll often refer to as the
/log/) about the device that it's using. As you can see, it all looks
ok: 2 channels out, samplerate of 44100Hz. At this point, the
=extempore= process is running, and will keep doing so until you kill
it.

Also, the compiler prints some information about 'starting up some
processes', namely a =primary= process on port =7099= and a =utility=
process on port =7098=. These are the TCP ports we'll send our code
to. A running Extempore binary can provide /multiple/ Extempore
processes[fn:threads], as well as connecting to multiple other
Extempore processes, potentially running on remote hosts. This forms
the basis for Extempore's powerful distributed processing capability,
which I'll cover in a future blog post. For the moment, though, you
don't have to worry about multiple processes, we'll only connect and
interact with the =primary= process.

* Connecting to the Extempore compiler

So far, all the stuff we've done has been in a shell console. The
=extempore= process, which provides the Extempore compiler, is just
sitting there idle, waiting to be given some code to evaluate. That's
where the text editor part of the equation comes in.

In this post I'm going to be fairly editor-agnostic, because (as I
mentioned before) as long your editor can open up the TCP connection
to the compiler and send code strings over it, then you're good to go.
In places where there are editor-specific instructions, I'll give
instructions for Emacs and ST2.

When you open up a file ending in =.xtm= (Extempore's default file
extension), your editor should detect that you're editing Extempore
source code, and load the appropriate Extempore plugin. Here's a
(short) example file containing some Extempore code:

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/text-editor-start.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

The content of the file is at the top, and I've also included a
representation of the 'echo area' at the bottom (the /minibuffer/ in
Emacs terminology). This is a part of your editor which displays
information about the results of different editor commands, and may
also be where the feedback from the Extempore compiler is 'echoed'
(printed out). It's blank at the moment.

Now that we have
- an editor open with some Extempore code
- an Extempore (editor) plugin loaded
-  the =extempore= process still running
we can open up the TCP connection. In Emacs, this is done with =M-x
extempore-connect=. In ST2, use the menu item =Tools > Extempore >
Connect...=. The default host and port arguments will be =localhost=
and =7099= respectively. If the connection is made successfully, then
=extempore= will echo back the string ="Welcome to extempore!"=.

* Evaluating code

Once everything's hooked up, then the compiler is just waiting there
for you to give it some code to evaluate. So, from a 'blank slate'
=.xtm= file, let's start with some basic Scheme arithmetic. If you're
playing along, you can write =(+ 1 2)= into your file somewhere.

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/scheme-code-input.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

This is where the 'Compiler as a Service' (CaaS) thing starts to get
real. Currently, the code =(+ 1 2)= is just text sitting in your
editor. It won't get compiled until you send it for evaluation. If
you're using Emacs, then the easiest way to do this is to move your
cursor somewhere inside the code =(+ 1 2)= and hit =C-M-x= (which is
bound to =extempore-send-definition=). In ST2, you can highlight the
code you want to evaluate and either go to =Tools > Extempore >
Evaluate...= or just hit =C-M-x=. This takes the whole expression
=(+ 1 2)= and sends it (as a string) to the running =extempore=
compiler.

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/scheme-eval.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

The orange 'box' in the diagram indicates code that has been sent for
evaluation. See how the code string (in grey) is sent over the
connection, and the result is sent back (also as a string) and
displayed in the echo area. Nothing is printed in the console where
=extempore= is running. Congratulations---you've just evaluated your
first Extempore code!

We can write some more code to =bind-val= a global variable =myPI=,
which is an xtlang global variable of [[file:2012-08-09-xtlang-type-reference.org][type]] =double=. If you evaluate
this with =C-M-x= (or whatever the command is in your editor) then
what happens is

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-eval-1.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

One difference from the previous (Scheme) example is that the
=extempore= compiler now prints a message to the console: =Bound myPI
>>> double=. Evaluating /xtlang/ code will always print a message to
the log about the name and type of the variables.[fn:scheme-output]
Also, notice how the string that is echoed back is "#t", which is the
Scheme/xtlang literal for boolean =true=. This is what the compiler
returns if the value is '=bind-val='ed successfully. It's worth
observing that what the =extempore= compiler prints to the log isn't
the same as the result it echoes back to the editor over the TCP
connection.

How about compiling an xtlang closure?

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-eval-2.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

=circle_area= is an xtlang closure which takes a (=double=) argument
representing the radius of a circle and returns the area of that
circle (another =double=). It also uses the global variable =myPI= which
we evaluated earlier. The closure compiled successfully, and the
compiler prints =Compiled circle_area >>> [double,double]*= to the
log. If there was a problem with the compilation, then the compiler
would have printed a (hopefully helpful) compile error to the log
instead.

Let's find out the area of a circle of radius =5.0= units. We need to
call =circle_area= with the argument =5.0=.

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-eval-3.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

When we evaluate the =(circle_area 5.0)= expression, a couple of
things happen. The code is sent to the compiler, which returns the
value =78.539816= to the editor. In addition, a message about
'creating a new [[file:2012-08-17-memory-management-in-extempore.org][memory zone]]' is printed to the log. That's because
this is the first time we've /called/ some xtlang code, and so a
memory zone needs to be set up to provide any =zalloc= memory. This
zone allocation won't happen if we evaluate the same code again,
because the default zone already exists. The compiler in this 'created
default zone' message is just telling us helpful things about the
state of our Extempore world.

As another example of the difference between the /return value/ of an
xtlang expression and any /side effects/ it may introduce, have a
think about how you would get the circle's area printed to the log
view, rather than returned and shown in the echo area.

The answer: we can wrap the call to the =circle_area= closure in a
call to =println=. =println= is a built-in function which prints (to
the log) a string representation of whatever arguments it is passed.

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-eval-4.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

This time, the result (=78.539816=) is printed to the log. And the
result returned to the editor is different, too---it's now =#t=.
That's because the =println= function returns a value, indicating
whether it was successful in printing its arguments to the log or not.
The actual /printing/ is a 'side effect' of the =println=
function---behaviour that happens during the course of the function's
execution.

As a final basic example, we can send code to the compiler more than
'one closure at a time'. Let's write another closure, this time for
figuring out the area of a 'doughnut'

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/doughnut-area.png" width="250px" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

Because we already have a closure (=circle_area=) for figuring out the
area of a circle, it makes sense to use that closure in our
=doughnut_area= closure. The area of the doughnut is the area of the
outer circle (radius =r1=) minus the area of the inner circle (radius
=r2=).

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-eval-5.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

See how this time both the definition of the =doughnut_area= closure
and the call =(doughnut_area 5.0 2.5)= are sent to the compiler in the
same 'chunk', meaning that they were both highlighted in the editor
before giving the evaluation command.  The results of this
evaluation indicate that the two parts of the code were both evaluated
successfully: the =doughnut_area= closure compiled successfully, and
the result =58.904862= was returned to the editor. 

* The power (and danger) of CaaS

Thus far in this post we've only evaluated code in the order it
appears in the file. Closures which use other closures or globals have
all worked fine. But when we kill the =extempore= process (i.e. with
=SIGINT=), the Extempore environment we've 'built up' isn't saved---it's
destroyed.

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/extempore-restart.png" width="300px" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

After restarting the =extempore= process above, and reconnecting the
editor to it, let's try compiling the =doughnut_area= closure first:

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-compile-error.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

The =circle_area= closure isn't there anymore, and so the compiler
throws an error (and no value is returned to the editor). Because the
compiler is a 'service', it'll just evaluate the code and build up the
environment in whatever order you throw code at it. The source code
isn't necessarily a linear representation of the evolution of the
environment---it all depends on the 'evaluation trajectory' that you
take through the code.

So, if we go back and evaluate all the necessary code, everything
works properly

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-eval-6.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

One other thing you can do is /redefine/ the behaviour of existing
functions and variables.  For example, say we wanted to change our
=circle_area= function to use an ancient Egyptian approximation for
the area of a circle described on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_papyrus][Rhind papyrus]] (c. 1800BC).

In the editor, /change the code/ for the =circle_area= closure and
re-evaluate:

#+begin_html
  <div class="ui image segment">
    <img src="/img/interacting-with-compiler/xtlang-eval-7.png" alt="">
  </div>
#+end_html

The result is (slightly) different, but not too far off---not bad for
a 4000 year old formula. But the main thing is that the code to /call/
=circle_area= didn't change---only the definition did. The new closure
definition has to have the same signature as the old one, so that any
code which calls the existing closure will still work ok
(type-signature wise). This re-configurability in the behaviour of the
code lies at the heart of [[http://toplap.org][live coding]], a practice which has informed
much of the design of Extempore.

This should be a serious challenge to any notion you may have had
about the source code being the canonical definition of how an
Extempore 'program' behaves. In live programming, the programmer is
constantly both building /new/ code and data structures, and also
redefining and re-evaluating /old/ bits of code to fit better with the
current execution and environmental context. There are lots of deep
implications of this way of thinking about programming, and I won't go
into them here, but hopefully this has been helpful for thinking about
what programming in Extempore looks like.

Now, if you want to code everything up in source files which are
evaluated linearly from start to finish (e.g. with a call to =load=)
then you can still do that, too.  All of the Extempore libraries
(including those for DSP and graphics) work that way, and Extempore
still works great in that paradigm.  But you have the ability to dive
in and change things if you need to, and that opens up some
interesting possibilities.

This post is really just the tip of the compiler-as-a-service (CaaS)
iceberg. Extempore's CaaS will also let you do things like query for
all bound symbols, print all closures of a particular signature type,
return the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][abstract syntax tree]] of a particular closure, etc... In
fact the Extempore compiler itself is fully runtime modifiable!

* Next steps

There are lots of places to go now, you can keep reading through the
[[file:../extempore-docs/index.org][docs]], or start poking around the =examples/= subdirectory in the
Extempore source folder (which will be in
=/usr/local/Cellar/extempore/<version>/= if you installed Extempore
through homebrew).

Once you start doing that, you'll notice that loading whole libraries
on startup each time is /slow/. The good news is you can get around
this by [[file:2013-12-16-building-the-extempore-standard-library.org][pre-compiling the xtlang standard library]]. You
don't have to use the standard library, but it will save you a lot of
time on startup, and you don't lose any flexibility (the xtlang
functions can all still be re-defined on the fly) so it's probably not
a bad idea to use the library unless you have a reason not to.

Enjoy, and remember that if you have any problems you can hit us up on
 the [[mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com][mailing list]].
 The standard
library is both a binary file (=libs/xtm.{dll,so,dylib}= depending on
your platform) and a =libs/xtm.xtm= file which is the 'header' for the
xtlang code in this library---it tells Extempore about what closures
and other data are present in the library and how to call them. 

# If you've read a few of the other blog post on this site about
# programming in (with xtlang or Scheme) in Extempore, then you've
# probably heard me talk about 'evaluating' code. If you're used to C or
# C++ (or any other statically compiled language) this might seem like a
# strange notion---code is /compiled/, then it is /executed/. The
# compiler produces a static binary (for a given architecture), which
# can be distributed and run all over the place. In general, if any
# changes are made to the code then the binary has to be re-compiled and
# re-distributed.

# On the other hand, if you've programmed in a lisp[fn:lisps], or in
# some type of scripting language (e.g. perl, ruby or python), then
# you've probably seen a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) before. Also called
# 'interactive' development, in this style of programming you write bits
# of code, run them, and have the results printed 'echoed' back to you.
# The interpreter for the programming language /reads/ the code that you
# give it, /evaluates/ it (carries out the instructions it represents)
# and /prints/ the result. These REPL-style environments can be
# super-sophisticated,[fn:slime] providing lots of dynamic information
# about the state of the interpreters 'world' (often called the
# /environment/), i.e. the functions and data that the interpreter has
# seen in that programming session and is keeping track of.

# * Extempore and the (false) 'static vs dynamic language' dichotomy

# If you want to start a flame war on the internets, then just write a
# blog post called *Moving from (static language/framework x) to
# (dynamic language/framework y) at (company z)*. Bonus angry points if
# *company z* is a hot YC-backed startup, and a 10x multiplier if you
# mention clojure or node.js. Then you can sit back, watch the hacker
# news comment thread deteriorate, and weep for humanity. Ridiculousness
# aside, however, the dichotomy is kindof a false one anyway. In reality
# it's more of a spectrum, and both ends of the spectrum confer
# different advantages and disadvantages. The pertinent question for
# this post is /where does Extempore fit along this continuum/?

[fn:security] Currently Extempore doesn't support encrypted
connections for this purpose, and will blindly accept any connection
which makes the right handshake. This is obviously a security risk,
which will be addressed in a future release. For the moment, either
block the default ports (=7098= and =7099=) in your firewall so that
only machines on the local network can connect to Extempore, or cross
your fingers and rely on security through obscurity.

[fn:scm-vs-xtlang] There are lots of [[file:../2012-08-09-xtlang-type-reference.org][other]] [[file:../2012-08-17-memory-management-in-extempore.org][posts]] describing xtlang in
more detail. In this post, I'll just refer to the code generally, only
clarifying whether its Scheme or xtlang when there's a possibility for
confusion.

[fn:clock] This is a good thing: the audio clock will usually be more
stable and accurate than your computer's default system clock,
especially if you're using a dedicated external audio interface.

[fn:threads] Extempore's processes are kindof like POSIX threads.

[fn:scheme-output] Interpreted Scheme code, on the other hand, won't
cause the =extempore= process to print anything to the log.

# [fn:lisps] That is, one of the lisp family of languages, e.g. Common
# Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Emacs Lisp, etc.

# [fn:slime] Have you /seen/ a lisp hacker using Slime and Emacs?  Wow.
# That's some seriously funky stuff.
