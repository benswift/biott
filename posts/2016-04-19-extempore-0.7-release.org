If you're on the [[mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com][extempore mailing list]] then you've already heard that
Extempore has a new 0.7 release.  Here's the announcement, in case you
missed it:

Hi folks

Those of you who have been github-stalking Andy and I recently will know
that we've been preparing a new 0.7 release.  Here's a brief overview of
the changes:

- everything.
  
That's a *small* exaggeration, but it's true that there have been heaps
of changes in the ~600 commits since 0.6.0.

From a user's perspective, one of the biggest changes is that we've got
binary releases for all platforms available on GH:

https://github.com/digego/extempore/releases/tag/0.7.0

Binary releases are something that we've been asked about for a while
now, and will hopefully make it even easier to get up and running even
than things like homebrew.

If that's not your cup of tea, then the cmake-powered build-from-source
process is easier than it's ever been, check out
http://digego.github.io/extempore/install.html for details.

We've done our best to make sure the binaries will work everywhere, but
if you have issues then let us know. We'll be revealing more about the
changes to the language etc. in future mailing list posts, but as usual
if you get stuck then fire an email to the mailing list and we'll do our
best to help out.

Finally, there's a new documentation website up online at

http://digego.github.io/extempore/

It's automatically generated from the files in the extempore `docs/`
subfolder, which means that if you find something that's wrong or have
an idea to improve the docs, you can just edit those files and let us
know through a GitHub pull request.  You don't need to be a command-line
ninja to do that - the GitHub web interface lets you edit the files
in your web browser:

https://github.com/digego/extempore/tree/master/docs

Love youse all,
Ben

As mentioned, this blog is being put out to pasture as the *primary*
source of Extempore documentation.  It's had a good run, but a proper
ReadTheDocs-powered documentation system just makes it easier for the
Extempore community to get involved in keeping things up to date and
making them better.  So get amongst it!
