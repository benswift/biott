{:title "Blog refresh"
 :layout :post}

Another year, and another blog refresh. It's still a clojure-powered
static site with messy hand-rolled (s)css, but this time
with [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/), which seems pretty nice.

The other big change is that the Extempore documentation posts have
all been removed. A little while ago I did some work to set up the
Extempore docs on
a [separate site](http://digego.github.io/extempore/), and that really
is the best place to go for that stuff now. I considered keeping my
old blog posts around for posterity, but a lot of it was out-of-date
anyway, so I decided it was safest to get rid of it completely and
redirect people to the new documentation site.

As always, if you get stuck, let me know on
the [Extempore mailing list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com).
