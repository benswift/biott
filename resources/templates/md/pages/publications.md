I'm a [Research Fellow](http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/4919) in the
School of Computer Science at the Australian National University,
working under Prof. John Hosking and Assoc. Prof. Henry Gardner.

My primary research interest these days is **livecoding**, and I'm
currently working on [Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore)
(as you may have been able to guess from the content of [this
blog](../latest-posts/index.html)). Before Extempore came along I was an
[Impromptu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au) user, and have been live
coding since 2007. You can check out some of my screencasts [on
vimeo](http://vimeo.com/benswift/videos).

I have a PhD in Computer Science from the Australian National
University. My research project was a cross-disciplinary project between
computer science and digital media
([thesis](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18333720/master.pdf)). Prior to that I
did a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics at the ANU.

If you want to get in touch, email is best---you can reach me on

## Potential students

If you're interested in doing research with me, particularly in
livecoding with Extempore, then [get in touch](mailto:ben@benswift.me).
If you can, send me a link to something you've made: a livecoding video,
a project on GitHub, or something like that.
