I am a multidisciplinary researcher in the Research School of Computer
Science at the
[Australian National University](http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/4919).
My research interest cut across human-computer interaction, high
performance & scientific computing and digital arts. The broad theme
underpinning my interests in these areas is the potential of
*liveness* (real-time human-in-the-loop interactivity) in
programming tools and workflows, especially in open-ended exploratory
programming.

I have made significant
[open-source code contributions](https://github.com/benswift) to the
international research and livecoding communities, especially through
my work on [Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore): the 
state-of-the-art in livecoding languages.

I am also an internationally-recognised digital artist, and have
performed at both local and international arts festivals---you can
find examples of my [livecoding on vimeo](https://vimeo.com/benswift/videos).

If you want to get in touch, email is best---you can reach me on
<ben.swift@anu.edu.au>.

### Potential students

If you're interested in doing Hons/Masters/PhD research with me,
then [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au). If you can, send me
a link to something you've made: a livecoding video, a project on
GitHub, or something like that.
