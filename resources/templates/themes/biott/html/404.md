## Page not found

Whoops, can't find that page. Sorry about that.

If you're looking for my **Extempore documentation**, that's all grown up
now and [has a site of its own](http://digego.github.io/extempore/).
A lot of the Extempore stuff on my blog was out-of-date anyway, so
I decided it was safest to get rid of it completely and redirect
people to the new documentation site.

As always, if you get stuck, let us know on
the [Extempore mailing list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com).
