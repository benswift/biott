Extempore's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming][generics]] have gotten a pretty substantial update in
a commit (=9c674c9=) that Andrew pushed earlier today.  This
represents a heap of hard work by him, and a whole lot of goodies for
xtlang programmers.

Generics allow you to write xtlang code which doesn't specify the
types of the arguments/variables
